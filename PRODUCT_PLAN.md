# Tig roadmap

Tig connects small Git-authored references to immutable bytes and explicit storage
obligations. It remains usable for Git/LFS without typed asset schemas, and across
unrelated projects without built-in media or cache policy.

## Implemented experimental slices

- Pure identity/trees, bindings, claim handoff and bounded placement arithmetic.
- Local publication, scoped coordination, capacity journals, retained claims and
  recovery primitives with synthetic and real-client fixtures.
- Exact commit/index extraction, source journals and download-only Git LFS cache
  interoperability. Stores are explicitly enrolled, never discovered.
- Optional native records, schema admission, graphs, sparse variants, production
  contexts, revision/delivery history and sparse Git proposals.
- Explicit Rust project restore, handoff/progress evidence and history inspection.
- Local catalogue: work counts, nested navigation, search, versions, guarded
  metadata expansion, coverage, copy observations, placement preferences and
  work/version/object comparisons. Movement/removal remains a held review.

Current contracts and [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) limit each claim.
[Evidence](docs/vtrace/EVIDENCE.md) records historical checkpoints rather than
certifying full requirements or every consumer.

## Remaining milestones

| Milestone | Exit condition |
| --- | --- |
| Public source readiness | Generic docs/examples, license/provenance review, privacy audits and explicitly approved publication history |
| Consumer completeness | Explainable declared versus consumed inputs, opaque gaps, active jobs and exact profile/source coverage |
| Lifecycle reconciliation | Durable scoped demands and idempotent plans across Git changes, interruption and concurrent work |
| Guarded execution | Independent retained custody, provider revalidation and authority before retirement; physical reclaim measured in isolated fixtures |
| Catalogue usability | Comparable coverage, shared bytes, versions and primary subtypes; explicit enrollment and tool handoff |
| Providers/transfers | Capability/operational/license review and separate recovery/custody proof for remote or optional torrent adapters |

No deadline or completed consumer migration is implied. Catalogue work can advance
independently of deletion. Do not create a second cache engine or global cache
lock to complete a milestone. Estimates, observations, protection and authority
remain distinct.

The [17 work packages](docs/vtrace/WORK_PACKAGES.md),
[catalogue roadmap](docs/CATALOGUE-UI-PLAN.md) and
[adoption gates](docs/CONSUMER-ADOPTION.md) provide finer allocation.
